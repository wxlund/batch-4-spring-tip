      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

  41       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  42       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  43       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  44       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  45       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  46       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  47 
  48       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  49       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  50       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
  51       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
  52       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  53       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  54       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  55       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
  56       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
  57       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  58       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  59       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  60       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  61 
  62       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  63       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  64       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  65 
  66    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  67       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  68       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  69       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  70       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  71       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  72 
  73    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  74       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  75       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  76       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  77       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  78       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  79       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  80       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  81       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  82       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  83       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  84       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  85       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  86       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  87       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  88 
  89    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  90       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  91       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  92       meet the following conditions:
  93 
  94       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
  95           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  96 
  97       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  98           stating that You changed the files; and
  99 
 100       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 101           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 102           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 103           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 104           the Derivative Works; and
 105 
 106       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 107           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 108           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 109           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 110           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 111           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 112           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 113           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 114           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 115           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 116           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 117           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 118           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 119           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 120           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 121           as modifying the License.
 122 
 123       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 124       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 125       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 126       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 127       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 128       the conditions stated in this License.
 129 
 130    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 131       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 132       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 133       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 134       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 135       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 136       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 137 
 138    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 139       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 140       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 141       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 142 
 143    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 144       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 145       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 146       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 147       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 148       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 149       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 150       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 151       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 152 
 153    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 154       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 155       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 156       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 157       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 158       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 159       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 160       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 161       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 162       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 163       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 164 
 165    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 166       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 167       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 168       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 169       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 170       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 171       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 172       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 173       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 174       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

=== Licensing ===

Jackson can be used for any purpose, but to (re)distribute it,  distributors
(such as libraries and frameworks that use Jackson) will need to
choose which License they want to apply to distribution, and to use appropriate
jars that enclose license documentation.
No work needed beyond choosing the appropriate jar(s).

Currently two Open Source licenses are available for use:

* Apache License 2.0 (AL 2.0)
* Lesser/Library General Public License (LGPL 2.1)

These licenses have proven adequate to cover all current use cases.

A large portion of the dictionary entries
originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.

Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

NO WARRANTY

The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
research and development conducted during the project and is provided
to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
any right of any third party.

Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
production of secondary products from the program.

In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
above as far as the program is concerned.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise
make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. 
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. sec. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE
MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS

   and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
   derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
   literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
   cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
   be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
   derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
   Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
   this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
   work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
   timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
   an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
   such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
   broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
   Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement
   of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the
   Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or
   more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent
   works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
   whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
   an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
   and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale
   or other transfer of ownership.

   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
   that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
   work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the
   Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher;
   and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
   musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
   play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
   expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
   being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
   performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts,
   the organization that transmits the broadcast.

   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
   terms of this License including without limitation any production
   in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
   the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such
   as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon
   or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
   work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
   composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
   assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
   a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving
   or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
   expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art;
   an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative
   to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance;
   a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is
   protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
   or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
   literary or artistic work.

   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
   with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
   previous violation.

   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
   Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by
   any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
   a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
   and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
   public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
   the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
   to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
   sounds or images.

   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
   without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
   fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
   of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
   electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
   more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
   steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
   were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
   marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
   a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
   incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
      the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
      You of the rights granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
      of the rights granted under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
      to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
      the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
      voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
      by You of the rights granted under this License.  The above rights
      may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
      hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
      modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
      in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights
      not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
   terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
   ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
   that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform
   the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on
   the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from
   You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms
   of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
   in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from
   the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
   You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
   to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
   required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
   upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
   remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b),
   as requested.

   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
   to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
   name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
   and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
   or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
   for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
   notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
   such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
   to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
   a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
   "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
   based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
   by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
   provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
   a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
   authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
   these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
   may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
   attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
   under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or
   imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
   Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
   or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
   permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
   or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
   Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
   or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
   be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
   agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
   of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
   make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
   modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
   Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
   as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
   right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
   but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR
BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
   Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
   licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
   full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
   will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
   here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
   the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
   the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not
   serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,
   or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
   this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
   as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
   under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
   of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
   action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
   reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
   and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
   with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
   agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
   here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
   modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
   September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
   the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
   rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction
   in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
   the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
   provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
   rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
   rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
   deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended
   to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
